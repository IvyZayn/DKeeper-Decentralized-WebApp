# DKeeper

Welcome to my DKeeper project which is supported by Udemy - The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp. This webApp is deployed by dfx and note.js in the environment of ICP(Internet Computer) simulator with backend supported by Motoko, and frontend by CSS, HTML, and React.

To get started, you might want to download the repository and try the following commands:

```bash
cd DKeeper-Decentralized-WebApp/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to render the app locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies by node
npm install 

# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy

# Start a development server
npm start

```

Once the job completes, the application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
